# Distribution Centers Optimization
An optimization solution for determining the optimal assignment of distribution centers in a logistics network. 

This project uses a backtracking algorithm implemented in Java to minimize the total annual cost associated with transportation and fixed operating costs.

## Features
- Backtracking algorithm for optimal distribution center assignment.
- Integration with Dijkstra's algorithm for efficient pathfinding.
- Practical example included to illustrate the solution.
